# Otter requirements and boundaries

This document records product requirements together with their implementation status. A requirement marked as canonical or implemented is not automatically a production-scale scientific qualification claim.

## Product model

Otter provides one project and task entry point for RRBS, WGBS, RNA-seq, BS-PDX, and RNA-PDX:

```text
otter → craftmake → enva → operators → bamdriver
```

The project is dual-track. Canonical v1 runs use Craftmake after immutable resolution. Established `otter.yaml` projects use explicit Snakemake compatibility. Snakemake removal is a separate future decision.

## Implemented current contracts

- Typed canonical project, samples, reference lock, and run models.
- Strict parsing, source tracking, migration diagnostics, and digest drift detection.
- Immutable `run.yaml` creation and run-local paths.
- Explicit orthogonal `executor` and `backend` selection.
- Craftmake local contract execution and structured command output.
- Site/backend detection with partial-SLURM fail-closed behavior.
- Reference registry metadata, manifest/checksum verification, run override, and audited promotion.
- Five-scenario workflow/catalog contracts and versioned artifact declarations.
- Cancel, recovery, task correlation, report, and controller evidence contracts.
- Stable CLI/file contracts for the current component repositories.

## Requirements for continued qualification

### Configuration and execution

- New runs must resolve `project.yaml`, `samples.tsv`, and reference locks into `run.yaml` before execution.
- Craftmake must consume the resolved snapshot rather than infer missing values from project files or the environment.
- Compatibility runs must select `--executor snakemake` explicitly.
- Changes to samples, references, workflow assets, executor, toolchain, or immutable resources require a new run.

### Workflows and artifacts

- The five scenarios remain distinct even when they share workflow components.
- Executor comparisons hold toolchain, input, reference, and parameters constant.
- Tool comparisons hold executor constant.
- Artifact manifests bind outputs to run identity and snapshot digest.
- Exact, structural, scientific, and informational comparisons must not be conflated.
- Legacy-only extensions remain separately labeled rather than being presented as modern parity.

### References and environments

- Shared references are selected by logical ID/release and verified by manifest/checksum.
- Compute-node visibility is checked before production submission.
- Enva environments and external scientific tools retain their published names and formats.
- BAM-consuming operators reuse `bamdriver` semantics where applicable.

## Validation boundaries

### Local

Local checks cover compilation, unit tests, schemas, migration, DAGs, CLI protocol, fake backends, run identity, site detection, and state-machine behavior. Local checks are not evidence of production scientific performance.

### SLURM

Real workflows, scientific parity, cancellation/recovery under the scheduler, and throughput qualification require the approved SLURM environment and retained run evidence.

## Current Gate 6 boundary

Accepted evidence is bounded to the documented Craftmake–Snakemake executor comparison, corrected Gate A–D classification controls, and Methx/Methrix parity. Deferred extensions are:

- fresh seven-input legacy-equivalent matrix;
- representative `20 samples × 3 repeats` matrix;
- production-scale throughput and scheduler pressure;
- WGBS `SRR6373947` requalification;
- additional Snakemake interruption/recovery studies.

See [release readiness](release-readiness.md), the [benchmark plan](benchmark-plan.md), and the [evidence register](gate6-closeout-evidence-register.json).

## Future retirement decision

Snakemake retirement requires separate scenario-level scientific evidence, recovery and rollback procedures, production support ownership, and a documented compatibility-removal change. It cannot be inferred from a successful build, a local test, or the existence of Craftmake workflow files.
